# Proposal analysis

Forward looking. Everything in `docs/` describes the system **as it is**. This document is the
only place that discusses changing it.

Two things are analysed here:

1. **Quinn's proposed redesign**, and what each part of it would touch
2. **The combined plan**: Jotform keeps the forms, Airtable becomes the engine, Lovable renders the pages

Read [../docs/03-flow.md](../docs/03-flow.md) first. Nothing below makes sense without it.

## Part 1. What Quinn's proposal touches

Nine parts of the proposal land on an existing step. Five have no equivalent step at all.

| Mark | Proposal | Against the current system | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Three identifiers: Swim, Submission, Ratification | SWIM ID is the only identifier and is already labelled "RAT #" in the confirmation email. Adds two more namespaces and changes page URLs. | Replaces |
| 2 | Ratified Distance and GPS Track Distance shown separately, with a versioned methodology | One figure exists, measured manually in Google Maps and never recorded on any record. The confirmation email currently quotes the GPS figure. | New |
| 3 | Gate 1: four non-negotiable thresholds, auto-blocking | The route review is a single approval with no thresholds and no auto-check. | New |
| 4 | Gate 1 evidence check before committee | The observer report requires nothing but a Swim ID, and completeness is checked by a person opening a folder. | New |
| 5 | Page created at clearance, private draft through review, published on decision | This is already the design. The genuine delta is per-member authenticated access instead of one shared password. | Already exists |
| 6 | A live committee docket replacing the cloned form and the dispatch email | The form is cloned per swim only because submission caps are per form. Dispatch and reviewer counting are manual. | Replaces |
| 7 | Comments anchored to named parts of the record | Reviewer notes live inside form submissions and never reach the page. The proposal does not specify a mechanism. | New |
| 8 | Binary unanimous vote, 3 of 3, named reviewers, recusal and alternates | Closer to reality than it looks. The rule today is already a count: three ratified reviews means ratified. But twelve people are asked and the form caps at three, so the first three responses decide and a single not ratified among them ends it. His version, where anything short of unanimous stays pending rather than failing, would fix that. It still does not address a pool larger than three. | **Partly fixes** |
| 9 | WOWSA Decision, GWR Referral and GWR Status as separate lines, plus amendment versions | One outcome line. Amendments arrive as email replies with no record of what changed. | New |
| — | Public status page per submission | Nothing equivalent. Status is checked against a manually maintained Airtable table. | New |
| — | Public registry of every submission, permanent | Nothing equivalent. A permanent transparency commitment. | New |
| — | Notion as a precedent and policy repository | Nothing equivalent. Adds a tool and an ongoing writing workload. | New |
| — | Shared canonical data graph and stable join keys | Nothing equivalent. Forward planning for a consumer directory that does not exist yet. | New |
| — | Public protocol explainer page | Substantially exists already across the knowledgebase. | Already exists |
| — | "Not Ratified" replacing "Rejected" | "Rejected" has never been used. The terms in use are Not Ratified, attempted, and verified attempt for the public and social wording. | Already exists |
| — | Publishing Not Ratified decisions | Already happens, and those swims also receive a certificate and social assets as a verified attempt. | Already exists |

### The one genuine conflict, and it is not where it looked

The proposal describes the committee decision as "always a unanimous 3 of 3 vote", with quorum,
recusal and alternates.

The rule today is already a count: **three ratified reviews means the swim is ratified.** That part
matches. What does not match is everything around it. Twelve people are invited, nobody is
assigned, and the form caps at three submissions, so the first three to respond decide. One not
ratified among those three ends the case, even if a fourth reviewer would have ratified it.

**So the proposal partly fixes a real defect.** Treating anything short of unanimous as pending
rather than as a failure would stop the automatic not ratified. It does not address a reviewer pool
larger than three, and there is nothing to recuse from while nobody is assigned.

What still needs answering, and it is a governance question rather than a design one: is the rule
three ratified reviews regardless of any not ratified reviews from others, or is it the first three
to respond decide?

### WordPress

The proposal replaces the WordPress ratification pages with Lovable. Every public page section in
the document is labelled "PUBLIC PAGE · LOVABLE", and section 1 states it directly:

> Replaces: Manually built WordPress pages, a separate database-update step after publishing, and
> a page-build step that used to happen only after ratification.

The document does not address the separate WordPress install, the already indexed and already
circulated page URLs, the League Table plugin, or the embedded committee form that the entire
review depends on.

## Part 2. The combined plan

| Tool | Role | Change |
|---|---|---|
| **Jotform** | Forms and file uploads. Knows who each form belongs to, prefills and routes them | Keep. Stops running the process |
| **Airtable** | The single record for every swim. Runs every stage and every email. Acts on dates, chases, flags gaps | Build. Replaces the Jotform workflow |
| **Lovable** | Public ratification pages, private committee view and docket, public status pages | New. Replaces WordPress pages |

Jotform answers into Airtable. Airtable sends the next form when it is due. Lovable reads the record.

### Why this matters more than it looks

All three platform constraints in [../docs/11-constraints.md](../docs/11-constraints.md) exist because
**Jotform runs the process**. Moving the engine to Airtable removes all three at once:

| Constraint today | Consequence removed |
|---|---|
| Cannot act on a date | Post-swim forms go out on their own. Nobody checks a calendar |
| Cannot run steps in parallel | Observer and swimmer are asked at the same time |
| No CC or BCC | Internal copies stay internal |

Three defects also disappear structurally rather than being fixed:

- **Relay** becomes a field on one record instead of a second workflow
- **Add-ons** carried on the order trigger their own instructions
- **Rescheduling** moves everything after it, with no restart

### What becomes automatic

**What Claude can and cannot be asked to do.** A Claude agent cannot sit and wait for something to
happen. It is not a webhook target and not a service. Anything that has to react the moment a form
arrives, an order lands or a date passes belongs to Airtable, which is always on. Claude works on a
queue: Airtable notices something and collects it into a view, and Claude works through that batch
on a schedule or when asked. Useful for judgment and drafting. Not something to put underneath a
trigger that has to fire reliably.

Most of this is ordinary automation rather than AI. Only four rows genuinely need a Claude agent:
reading the observer log, writing the introduction, drafting chase emails, and producing the Canva
assets. Everything else is Airtable or Lovable doing what they already do.


| Stage | Today | After | How, and what does it |
|---|---|---|---|
| Order and intake | Automatic, but add-ons and solo versus relay are lost | Automatic and complete | **Airtable automation.** The order webhook writes the full line item, including the variation and any add-ons, straight onto the record |
| Route distance | Measured in Google Maps, screenshotted, emailed | Calculated from the coordinates and written to the record | **Airtable automation calling the distance service.** No AI involved, it is a calculation |
| Route approval | Emailed to Quinn, reply, then recorded separately | Quinn approves in one place and it records itself | **Airtable interface.** Quinn sees the route, the distance and any flags on one screen and approves there |
| Knowing the swim happened | Manual calendar check | Automatic | **Airtable scheduled automation.** Runs daily, finds swim dates that have passed, moves those records on. This must be Airtable rather than Claude, because it has to run whether or not anything else is running |
| Folders and file collection | One folder made manually, one automatic | Both automatic | **Airtable automation into Google Drive.** The swim folder is created from the template on clearance |
| Checking evidence is complete | Opening folders and noticing | Flagged automatically, with the chase email drafted | **Airtable formula and view** for what is missing. **A Claude agent** writes the chase email, because the wording depends on who is being chased and why |
| Observer log | Every entry retyped | Only solvable with an offline capable form | **Nothing yet.** Live capture and AI transcription have both been tried and neither worked. This stays manual until a form exists that works without signal. See the note under the recommendations |
| The introduction | Generated, then placed manually | Generated onto the record | **A Claude agent** against the existing tone, flow and wording rules |
| Building the page | Assembled manually across six systems | The page is the record. Nothing to assemble | **Lovable.** Reads the record and renders it. There is no build step to perform |
| Committee form | Cloned, edited and embedded per swim | No form to clone | **Lovable.** The review sits on the record, with access granted per member rather than per form |
| Committee dispatch and chasing | Email written manually, reviews counted manually | Automatic, with reminders to whoever has not responded | **Airtable automation.** Counts reviews as they arrive and reminds only the people still outstanding |
| Publishing the result | Two tables built manually, form removed, names and signatures added | Renders from the reviews as they arrive | **Lovable.** The determination panel reads the review records directly |
| Certificates and social cards | Made manually for every ratification | Generated from the record | **A Claude agent driving Canva.** Fills the templates from the record and exports into the swim folder |
| Status tracking | Typed in at every stage | The record is the status | **Airtable.** Each stage is written by whatever step performed it, so there is nothing to keep in sync |

### What still needs a person

Five things. These are the parts where WOWSA's judgment is the product, not the overhead.

| | What | Why it cannot move |
|---|---|---|
| Judgment | **Approving a route** | Everything can be prepared, measured and checked. Whether the plan is sound is a person's call |
| Judgment | **The committee's assessment** | Committee members deciding whether a swim meets the standard. The determination is a count, but what each reviewer submits is judgment. This is what WOWSA is for |
| Judgment | **Whether evidence is credible** | A system can confirm a photograph exists and carries a timestamp. It cannot judge whether the photograph shows the swim |
| Judgment | **Borderline threshold calls** | Whether an observer's role genuinely overlaps a crew role is not a pass or fail check |
| Field conditions | **Capturing anything live during a swim** | Already tried, twice. Rose built both an online observer log and a real time media submission form that captured timestamps at the point of capture. Both were field tested and neither held up. Crews are in open water with no internet and often no laptop |
| Craft | **The video, and choosing the photographs** | Which moments carry a swim is an editorial decision. The video is also cut in desktop software that nothing can reach |

**The determination itself is not judgment.** It is a count: three ratified reviews means ratified.
What each reviewer submits is entirely judgment, and that is the part that stays.

## Part 3. Recommendations, in neither plan

| # | Recommendation | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | An offline capable observer log form \* | Retyping the log is the largest repeated task in the process. A form is still the right answer, but it has to hold entries on the device and upload when the crew is back in signal. See the note below |
| 2 | Generate certificates and social assets from the record | Certificates appear nowhere in the proposal |
| 3 | Make the distance service the single source for both distance figures | Removes the manual measurement, fixes the wrong figure currently quoted to swimmers, and is what a versioned methodology needs to sit on. **In progress.** The service is built; circumnavigation routes still need work with Anthony at ZeroSixZero. https://github.com/rosevillanuevadev/wowsa-distance-calculator |
| 4 | Score evidence completeness on the record | Answers "is this ready for the committee" without anyone opening a folder, and without changing what the forms ask for |
| 5 | Surface anything sitting too long at one stage | The most common failure today is silent. A case that has not moved is the only signal needed to catch it |
| 6 | Remind committee members who have not responded | Chasing reviews is currently manual and batched. It should be a nudge per person per swim |
| 7 | Send add-on instructions automatically on purchase | People are paying for add-ons today and receiving nothing |
| 8 | Keep one identifier, not three | SWIM ID is already public, already in every URL, and the confirmation email already presents it as the ratification number. Adding two more namespaces creates work without answering a question anyone is asking |

### \* What has already been tried on the observer log, and why each failed

This is not an unexplored idea. Rose built and field tested two of the three approaches below
before any of this analysis existed.

**1. An online observer log form, built by Rose.** Intended to capture entries live during the
swim. Failed on connectivity. The crew is on a boat in open water, usually with no internet and
often no laptop.

**2. A real time media submission form, built by Rose,** capturing photograph timestamps at the
moment of capture rather than relying on metadata surviving the journey afterwards. Failed for the
same reason, and could not be made consistent.

**3. AI transcription of the paper or PDF log.** Tested and not accurate enough to rely on for an
evidence record.

**What this leaves.** The form was the right instinct and it failed on one specific thing, which is
the assumption of a live connection. A form that stores entries on the device and uploads when
signal returns has not been tried, and is the only version of this that has not already failed.

## Sequencing note

Recommendations 3 and 7, and the relay fix, do not depend on any of the above. They can be done
against the system as it stands today. Everything else assumes Airtable has become the engine.
